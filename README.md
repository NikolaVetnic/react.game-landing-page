# Game Landing Page Template

This is a game landing page template built in React. Landing page of the excellent [Blasphemous II](https://www.blasphemous2game.com/) was used as a reference.

Check out the [desktop preview](./preview/Preview_Desktop%202558%20×%2011194.jpg) as well as the [phone preview](./preview/Preview_Telephone%201290x15960.jpg) to decide whether this template suits your needs.

## Notes on How to Use the Template

Some hints on how to get the most out of the template:

-   Check out `:root` element of `./src/App.css` for quick access to some easy to configure global variables.
-   When stating `highlights` in the `TextBlock` component use lower case exclusively.
-   Some components are commented out solely due to personal preference.
